<p>this section is written in markdown. it is used primarily for discussion, explanation etc. first letâ€™s load our packages</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(slumdown)</code></pre>
<p>this would usually be about waffles but instead i will do something boring with cards and the <code>mpg</code> data frame and i will also illustrate the use of inline R commands 7</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pic &lt;- ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
theme_slum(palette = &quot;kunoichi&quot;) +
  xlab(&quot;engine displacement&quot;) +
  ylab(&quot;highway mileage&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>this chunk has created the <code>pic</code> variable, to draw the plot, we just include the R command <code>print(pic)</code></p>
