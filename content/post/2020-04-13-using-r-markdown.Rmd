this section is written in markdown. it is used primarily for discussion, explanation etc. first let's load our packages

```{r package load, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(slumdown)
```

this would usually be about waffles but instead i will do something boring with cards and the `mpg` data frame and i will also illustrate the use of inline R commands `r 1+6`

```{r picture}
pic <- ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
theme_slum(palette = "kunoichi") +
  xlab("engine displacement") +
  ylab("highway mileage")
```

this chunk has created the `pic` variable, to draw the plot, we just include the R command `print(pic)`

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
print(pic)
```
